# REF1161-N64-Datel-Game-Killer
The extracted N64 game saves and Kicad Schematic and PCB files for the Datel Game Killer for the N64.

This product overwrites targeted portions of the game save for the selected game to yield a modified game with hacks enabled. It does not upload a full game save to the attached game.

The game saves presented in this repository were clean before being modified by the Game Killer, so they only contain the Game Killer modifications.

The Pilot Wings 64 save only seems to work with the PAL version of the game. The rest appear to work with their NTSC counterparts.

PCB Thickness: 1.2 mm
